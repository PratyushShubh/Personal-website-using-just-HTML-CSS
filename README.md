I created a personal website portfolio using HTML and CSS to showcase my background, education, experience, and projects. The website is designed with a clean, modern aesthetic to provide a professional online presence. The homepage features an introduction about myself, highlighting my interests and goals. 

The education section details my academic journey, including my current integrated MTech program in Electronics and Communication Engineering at JIIT Noida, with expected graduation in 2027. It emphasizes my coursework and academic achievements.

In the experience section, I outline my internship at WMO Wireless Monitoring Station in Ghitorni, New Delhi, and other relevant experiences. This section is designed to demonstrate my practical skills and industry exposure.

The projects section showcases the various projects I've completed, such as the 4-bit binary adder and the motor control system for an autonomous vehicle. Each project includes descriptions, images, and links to detailed pages or repositories, illustrating my hands-on expertise in electronics and web development. 

The website is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices.
